    <h1>DAY 62</h1>
    <h2>LOVE'S CODE-HONOUR</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Timothy 5:17 (NIV)</p>
    <p>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and doctrine.</p>

    <p>When we reflect on our conversations about love, we will see that one of the primary indicators of love is the characteristic of giving, of prioritising the other person over oneself and not promoting self-interest or personal desires.</p>

    <p>In Romans 12:10, Scripture instructs us to be devoted and affectionate to one another in love, showing honour and giving preference to one another. From this, we can understand that honour is a manifestation of love. Now, what does it mean to honour someone? It means to hold them in high regard and esteem. Let's consider how the love relationship between Jesus and God the Father unfolded during His time on Earth. Jesus always deferred to the Father, despite the fact that He was also God.</p>

    <p>Wherever you find yourself in the body of Christ, the love of Christ within you should always compel you to honour your leaders. You may not necessarily agree with their appearance or teaching style, but they are the ones whom God has appointed to instruct you in His Word and doctrines. Galatians 6:6 (AMP) states, "The one who is taught the word [of God] is to share all good things with his teacher [contributing to his spiritual and material support]."</p>

    <p>Here's a thought: as we approach the time of year when people exchange love gifts, how about planning to show honour to your leaders? Send them an uplifting note and shower them with love and gifts. Let them experience your love. Through them, you have heard words that affirmed your identity in Christ, that provided encouragement during difficult times, and that changed your perspective of God, among many other things.</p>

    <p>Beloved, choosing to honour our leaders is a natural response for believers. Let love and honour for your leadership be a lifestyle.</p>
