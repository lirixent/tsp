    <h1 style="text-align: center;">DAY 84<br>ATTENTION!</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: Philippians 4:8 (TPT)</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"So keep your thoughts continually fixed on all that is authentic and real, honorable and admirable, beautiful and respectful, pure and holy, merciful and kind. And fasten your thoughts on every glorious work of God, praising him always."</p>
    
    <p>In Genesis 3, the serpent approached Eve with a narrative that contradicted the one given by God. Consider this: how could the serpent claim that eating the fruit would make Eve "like God" (verse 4) when both she and Adam were already created in His image?</p>
    
    <p>Let's examine the various gates that were activated in this scenario:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, the serpent SPOKE to the woman (through the Ear Gate).</li>
        <li>Secondly, she SAW the tree and found it desirable (through the Eye Gate).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Here's a question worthy of note: was the tree already present before the serpent's arrival, or did Eve only take notice of it after the serpent drew her attention to it? Throughout this process, the tree may have appeared appealing for consumption, but due to the existence of an instruction, Eve did not perceive it that way until the serpent brought it to her attention. What captures your attention holds significant importance. You must exercise caution regarding what captivates or attracts your attention, as it ultimately shapes your thoughts, emotions, and decisions.</p>
    
    <p>It's interesting to note that Eve did not consider the tree as good for food or as something that would make her wise until the serpent suggested it. Similarly, certain things might be within your view or stored in your memory, but they remain suppressed until attention is drawn to them.</p>
    
    <p>What you desire to see or what you choose to give your attention to is precisely what you will perceive. If you anticipate failure or weaknesses, those will be the aspects you notice. Conversely, if you expect to encounter goodness, you will be more inclined to recognize it. Your consciousness determines your reality.</p>
    
    <p>Therefore, as a child of God, it is crucial to remain vigilant and on guard.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>What easily draws or gets my attention?</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">CONFESSION</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Daily, I take safety precautions to guard my ear and eye gates. I take careful charge of my thought life and I am mindful of what gets my attention.</p>
