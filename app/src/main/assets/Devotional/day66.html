    <h1>DAY 66</h1>
    <h2>WE ARE BENEFICIARIES</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: I John 4:19</p>
    <p>"We love Him because He first loved us."</p>

    <p>It is important to know that our love walk will be much easier and fulfilling when we understand one truth: God is the one who initiates, sustains, and completes everything from the abundance of His love and grace.</p>

    <p>Throughout the scriptures, we find this truth reiterated over and over again, and we will look at a few examples today:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In Ephesians 1:4 - He called us first, from the foundation of the world, long before we were born. God, being complete all by Himself, without the need for us, decided that it was pleasing to Him to create us and recreate us to be just like Him in love.</li>
        <li>In Romans 3:23, 24 - He justified us and gave us new life. Even though we were the ones who went astray, because of the riches of His mercy, He reached out to us to justify us and make us righteous.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, 1 Peter 1:5 proves to us that He is sustaining us daily in faith. Not only did He initiate our faith, but He is also keeping us in faith by His power.</li>
        <li>And as we walk and grow in our new life, we can rest assured that we have a lifeline. In fact, He spoke to us first through Jesus (Hebrews 3:1) and has answered our prayers even before we asked.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All of this is because He loves us! Dear believer, if God has gone ahead of us to do all these things because of His love for us and not because we loved Him or did all the right things or prayed the perfect prayer, but simply because it pleased Him to do so, then all we have to do is open our hearts and receive.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Today, turn off the noise and reflect on the unconditional, all-encompassing love God has for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I am blessed with all spiritual blessings and qualified for all God's promises in Christ.</p>
    </div>
