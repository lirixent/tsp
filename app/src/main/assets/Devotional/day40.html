        <h1>DAY 40</h1>
        <h2>USE YOUR ADVANTAGE</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: 1 Corinthians 2:15-16 (NIV)</h3>
        <p>"The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, for; 'Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?' But we have the mind of Christ."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Two things that are common every new year are goal-setting and New Year's resolutions, which are great for accountability. However, they are only part of a much bigger picture.</p>

            <p>As believers, we have a greater advantage because of God's Spirit. Our spirit is one with God's Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, and this means there is the capacity for communication and understanding between us and God, just like we do with men. This means that the benefits that our network or human interaction contributes to achieving our goals are nothing compared to the unlimited possibilities we receive from our union with the Spirit of Christ (1 Cor 6:17).</p>

            <p>In fact, the work of the Spirit will make you do more. But if you depend on your blueprint or your plans, you will limit the power of the Holy Spirit. As a believer, you've got to move from depending on your natural ability to the supernatural ability that the Spirit supplies.</p>

            <p>We are in an age where we think we are intelligent enough, sufficient enough. We want to analyze everything; we want it to make sense our way. However, there is no place for natural logic and analysis in the gospel. Instead, we no longer produce results from our sufficiency but from His sufficiency (2 Corinthians 3:5). Let the Holy Spirit lead the trajectory of your year and direct your plans and calculations.</p>

            <p>This year, become so accustomed to the leading of the Holy Spirit that it becomes your only way of thinking. Maximize your advantage.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Are the goals I've written down spirit-inspired or sense-inspired?</p>

        <h3>Declaration</h3>
        <p>Divine wisdom, resources, strategies, and witty inventions dwell on my inside.</p>
