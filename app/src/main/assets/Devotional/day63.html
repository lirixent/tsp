    <h1>DAY 63</h1>
    <h2>SPIRIT OF UNITY</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Corinthians 1:10 (NLT)</p>
    <p>I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony with each other. Let there be no divisions in the church. Rather, be of one mind, united in thought and purpose.</p>

    <p>Our understanding of love and the part we play in expressing this love we have received is not comprehensive if we don't know that there will be attacks. Not just any attack, but internal attacks designed to fight the unity of the body of Christ.</p>

    <p>The devil knows that he cannot destroy the church or fight the church and prevail, so the one thing he is going to do is to divide the church. So you find disunity in the church. Now, it is important to know that the spirit of division does not just happen without people being vessels for that spirit to be in operation.</p>

    <p>You look at a local assembly and find that there are sects and factions. Certain people walk into the church and bring in strange spirits; they bring in the spirit of self, the spirit of fighting leadership, and causing division in the church, leaving in their wake brokenness and crisis. This is why the church really needs to come together and in unity be fortified to withstand disunity in any shape or form it presents itself. (Romans 16:17)</p>

    <p>Don't be that person who doesn't really care about the brothers and sisters God has given you or surrounded you with. Instead, you want to show off and be noticed. (1 Corinthians 12:25,27)</p>

    <p>If you want to go far as a believer, you must be filled with the Spirit of unity. And this is not necessarily in the actions, but it begins first in the heart. That's why in 1 Corinthians 13, Paul was essentially saying that if you don't have love in your heart, what you do doesn't really matter.</p>

    <p>We must never allow anything to break our unity; rather, we must mirror the unity characteristic of Christ. (Philippians 2:1-5)</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Do my actions as a believer cause divisions in the body or do I promote unity, love, and honour for authority?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I deliberately perceive my brothers and sisters in the body of Christ through the lens of love only.</p>
