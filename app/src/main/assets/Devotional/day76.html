    <h2>PURE HEART AND A GOOD CONSCIENCE</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Timothy 1:5 (NKJV)</p>
    <p>"Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith."</p>

    <p>A good heart is that which sees through the lenses of God's love. In the same vein, a good conscience is one informed by the word of God about what is right or wrong. It is not overly sensitive to things that don't matter and, at the same time, it does not violate matters of importance. The opposite of a good conscience is a seared conscience that cares about nothing or is insensitive to what God has said.</p>
    
    <p>The objective of our love growth as believers is to cultivate a love that flows from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith (1 Timothy 1:5). It is essential for you to firmly grasp the reality that you possess a pure heart and a good conscience irrespective of your perceived weakness or flaws.</p>
    
    <p>This understanding is why forgiveness will come easily to you, regardless of the offence. In fact, it is actually easier for you to be forgiving than unforgiving. To be unforgiving is like carrying a heavy weight in the heart. This is why you feel heavy within when you refuse to let go. Therefore, you must protect your heart from being contaminated by jealousy, bitterness, anger, revenge, and other negative emotions.</p>
    
    <p>A believer can love from a clear conscience regardless of his or her negative past experiences or actions. This is why Paul could boldly declare that he has wronged no man (2 Cor 7:2). Loving from a clear conscience places the ability to love entirely on the finished work of Christ (1 Timothy 1:14). One can totally love and not feel like he/she is pretending because the love of Christ does not ignore what has happened in the past but is rather driven by pure motivations at all times.</p>
