        <h1 class="title">DAY 10: PRAYER - TO KNOW THE HOPE OF HIS CALLING</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Ephesians 1:18 (NIV)</h2>
        <p class="verse">“I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            The imagery of the "eyes of your heart" suggests a deeper, spiritual perception beyond mere intellectual understanding. Through prayer, we invite the Holy Spirit to enlighten the eyes of our hearts, allowing us to see and comprehend the profound dimensions of God's calling and the hope it holds.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            God's calling is accompanied by a unique and purposeful hope. As we pray to know the hope of His calling, we seek to understand the specific plan and purpose God has for our lives. Romans 8:28 (NIV) assures us, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Hebrews 6:19 (NIV) describes hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. Knowing the hope of God's calling through prayer provides stability and assurance in life's uncertainties. It is a hope that transcends circumstances and anchors our souls in the unchanging promises of God.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Prayer for the knowledge of the hope of His calling is not passive; it is an active pursuit of alignment with God's purpose. As we pray, we seek to discern His will, surrender our plans to His leading, and willingly walk in the path He has called us to. Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV) reassures us of God's good plans: “For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”
