    <h2>LOVE CONVEYORS</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: Ecclesiastes 7:9 (NIV)</p>
    <p>"Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools."</p>

    <p>If a lump of clay is not yielded or malleable in the hands of the potter, it will certainly come out looking misshapen. In the same way, it's important for a believer to be submitted to the dealings of the Spirit of Love so that you can be thoroughly furnished for good works.</p>

    <p>If we have truly received the love of God, which is essentially the giving of Jesus (John 3:16), then it is difficult for our love to seek its own or be all about our own self-interest. Romans 12:10 says to prefer one another in honor. This is not far-fetched from our everyday life. Pause for a second and think about your colleague, sibling, friend, spouse, or neighbor, and ask yourself: Who do I put first? Myself or this other person?</p>

    <p>Scripture in 1 John 4:7 tells us that love is of God, and everyone who is born of God has received the capacity to love. So the question is: Are you born of God? Are you saved? Then you are not easily provoked.</p>

    <p>You must realize that our love walk as believers goes beyond just the act of love and is also tested when you are on the receiving end of an interaction and you're not in control of the action or offense that has been done to you.</p>

    <p>Your nature of love is inseparable from you and should not be compartmentalized based on your location or the people you are interacting with. Love is your lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Am I easily provoked or am I quicker to react in love when people do things to me?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I am a device through which the Spirit of love is conveyed.</p>
