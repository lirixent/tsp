        <h1>DAY 60</h1>
        <h2>WITHOUT FEAR</h2>
        <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 John 4:18</h3>
        <p>"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love."</p>
        
        <p>A skilled player in a game demonstrates their ability to anticipate the moves of other players and respond accordingly. If you were aware that offense would likely occur, possibly as frequently as every 2 minutes during the day, you would be so secure in yourself that there would be no need to take offense. Instead, your response would be different.</p>
        
        <p>It is crucial to distinguish between responding in love because you desire to reconcile with your brother and responding in love because you want your brother to feel remorse. Same action, different intentions. If someone offends you, and then you think to yourself, "I will show him kindness so that he will realize the impact of his actions on me. I will respond with kindness to teach him a lesson," that's not the right approach. Instead, you must respond with the spirit of meekness and humility. Let your loving response reflect the goodness that leads us to repentance.</p>
        
        <p>The truth is, when you hesitate to love, it stems from fear. It indicates that you feel insecure and prefer to safeguard your ego. However, fear has no place in the love we have received. Our text today emphasizes that "Perfect love casts out all fears." It eliminates all fears, not just some. Additionally, 2 Timothy 1:7 reaffirms this notion: Love, not fear.</p>
        
        <p>The power of God's love is a force that propels you towards becoming more like Christ. If your goal is to emulate Christ, then love wholeheartedly.</p>
        
        <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>What fears have I allowed to keep me from loving like Christ?</p>
        
        <h3>DECLARATION</h3>
        <p>I am confident in the love of God I have received and I do not shy away from expressing it whether or not people are deserving.</p>
