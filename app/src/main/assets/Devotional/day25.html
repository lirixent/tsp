        <h1>DAY 25</h1>
        <h2>IN THIS IS LOVE</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: John 4:10 (NIV)</h3>
        <p>"This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the Gospel, the dynamics of love are distinctly different. It's not about a reciprocal exchange; rather, it’s an overwhelming act of God's love for us. The new covenant, established through Jesus Christ, reveals a love that precedes any action on our part. God took the initiative in the grand narrative of redemption.</p>

            <p>Unlike the old covenant, which required human initiative, the new covenant highlights God's decisive action. Our redemption doesn’t hinge on our ability to love God first; it rests on His boundless love, demonstrated through the sacrificial death of Jesus. He loved us first, and we respond in gratitude.</p>

            <p>In this new covenant of love, our confidence is not rooted in our efforts but in the immeasurable love God has for us. We find security not in our imperfect love but in His perfect love, which surpasses human comprehension. Our assurance comes from the unwavering love He displayed at the cross.</p>

            <p>Let us marvel at the initiative of God's love. It was never about us taking the first step; it has always been about God reaching out to us through Jesus Christ. In this revelation, we find comfort, security, and the assurance that our salvation is secure in His hands.</p>

            <p>As you reflect on God's love, remember: in this is love—He loved us first. Our confidence and boasting are not in our abilities, but in His love that knows no bounds. Embrace the assurance that comes from the initiative of God’s love, expressed through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Do I sometimes boast in my abilities or strengths?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>I am assured of God's love for me, and I make my boast in it.</p>
