        <p class="introduction">I CARRY HIS PRESENCE</p>
        <h2>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSES: Psalm 16:11 (NIV)</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Jesus, before ascending to heaven, promised his disciples the gift of another comforter, the Holy Spirit (John 14:16-17). This comforter of the same kind as Jesus would abide with believers forever. The Holy Spirit is not a distant force but a constant companion, dwelling in us and with us.</p>
        <p>Just as Jesus brought comfort to those who walked with him physically, the Holy Spirit continues this ministry within us. His comforting presence reassures us, guides us, and empowers us to face life’s challenges with confidence. In times of distress, the Holy Spirit is our source of solace and strength.</p>
        <p>Today, you are a carrier of the presence of God. Unlike in the Old Testament where the presence of God resided in a specific location or on a selected few, now we can all come boldly. When Jesus died, the veil demarcating God’s presence was torn in two. This shifts your focus from circumstances to the eternal reality that Christ is in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27).</p>
        <p>In every step you take and every challenge you face, remember that you carry the presence of God. The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, brings assurance, peace, and joy. His presence is not limited by external circumstances but transcends them, offering a profound sense of comfort that the world cannot provide.</p>
        <p>As you go about your day, carry with you the awareness that you are a bearer of God’s presence.</p>
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Do I move around confidently knowing I carry God’s presence?</p>
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I carry God’s Spirit on my inside everywhere I go.</p>
