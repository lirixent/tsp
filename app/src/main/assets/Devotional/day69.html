    <h1>DAY 69</h1>
    <h2>HAVE YOU GOT SELF-LOVE?</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 2 Corinthians 5:14,15 (TPT)</p>
    <p>"For it is Christ's love that fuels our passion and motivates us, because we are absolutely convinced that he has given his life for all of us. This means all died with him, so that those who live should no longer live self-absorbed lives but lives that are poured out for him—the one who died for us and now lives again."</p>

    <p>The nature of love is something that you already embody by virtue of what Jesus did on the cross; hence, you are already a loving person. Dear believer, do not confine yourself to preconceived notions of where your love begins and ends or how much you can love. No, do not remain there. Expand your mind to embrace the possibilities of how much more you can love. You have to affirm to yourself, "I will love differently."</p>

    <p>When love is the impetus in your heart, it becomes easy to say, "The love of God compels us." This means that no other emotion comes naturally to you anymore. Love has become your default state.</p>

    <p>That is why the concept of self-love that the world attempts to promote is foreign and unnatural to us. When the Bible addresses the self, it speaks of dying to self or being dead to self. If you contemplate it, the idea of self-love implies that the self is the source of love. However, if you recognize that your source is Christ, then you do not need to strive or compete to attain love for yourself because Christ's love already envelops you. And when you are secure in that love, you do not really dwell on 'yourself' in that sense. It shifts the focus from loving as "I love myself" to loving as Christ has called us to love (John 13:34,35 NIV).</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Do I really know that my default has changed? When I love, what is my driving force—Love or Self?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I am Love-absorbed, not Self-absorbed. Self-love is not my narrative. Instead, my motto is Christ-love.</p>
    </div>
