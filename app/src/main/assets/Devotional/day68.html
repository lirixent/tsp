    <h1>DAY 68</h1>
    <h2>BE ANXIOUS FOR NOTHING</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: Philippians 4:6 (NIV)</p>
    <p>"Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."</p>

    <p>Anxiety often stems from our inclination to handle things independently. This self-sufficient pride manifests when we strive to be in control of every aspect of our lives. The fear of losing control becomes the breeding ground for anxiety, creating a barrier to experiencing peace in the midst of uncertainties.</p>

    <p>The solution to worry lies in praying about everything. Instead of relying on our limited understanding and control, we are invited to present our concerns, worries, and uncertainties to God through prayer. This act of surrender is a tangible demonstration of trust in God's wisdom and sovereign plan.</p>

    <p>When we pray instead of worry, it signifies our trust in God. Regardless of how circumstances unfold, we acknowledge that God is in control. The act of presenting our requests to Him is an acknowledgment that only He can navigate the complexities of our lives. Trusting God becomes the antidote to anxiety.</p>

    <p>As we present our requests to God, we invite His intervention into our situations. Prayer is the channel through which we access the divine wisdom, guidance, and comfort that only God can provide. It is an exchange of our worries for God's peace, transcending human understanding.</p>

    <p>As you navigate each day, choose not to be anxious about anything but, through prayer and thanksgiving, present your requests to God. Recognize the source of anxiety lies in self-sufficient pride and the desire for control. Trust God in every situation, knowing that He is the ultimate source of peace, wisdom, and guidance. Let your prayers replace worry, and experience the transformative power of surrendering to God's sovereign control.</p>
