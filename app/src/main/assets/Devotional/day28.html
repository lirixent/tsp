        <h1>DAY 28</h1>
        <h2>LIVE OUT LOUD</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Romans 1:16,17</h3>
        <p>"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>To live out loud is to unapologetically and boldly preach the Gospel wherever you go. Living your best life in Christ for the whole world to see is also a means of showcasing your faith. Philippians 1:27-28 helps us understand that the gospel empowers us to be bold and unafraid, enabling us to live lives that reflect the gospel.</p>

            <p>We have been given a glorious mandate to tell the world about the free gift of Jesus we have received. This is the primary ministry of the believer. 2 Corinthians 5:18 says, "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation."</p>

            <p>Proverbs 28:1 tells us that boldness is a characteristic of the righteous. Furthermore, the source of this boldness is not our background, education, socio-economic status, or spiritual gifts. It is not even our behavior because our behavior does not determine our identity. Our boldness is a gift of righteousness!</p>

            <p>If we truly believe that people who are not born again, even those we love, will be eternally lost in hell, we won't hold back in sharing our faith. Having received this glorious mandate, we can't watch people miss out on what has been fully paid for.</p>

            <p>Let every opportunity we have to share our faith not pass us by. Use your influence, your social media platforms, your time, your wealth, your connections for the Gospel. There are people around you who may never hear the Gospel except you speak. Remember today, you may be presented with an opportunity to share the love of God and live out your faith.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Are there opportunities to share my faith that I may have ignored for a long time?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>I boldly declare the gospel of Jesus Christ that I have received.</p>
