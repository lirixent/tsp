        <h1>DAY 56</h1>
        <h2>THE LOVE NATURE</h2>
        <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: I John 4:16 (TPT)</h3>
        <p>"We have come into an intimate experience with God's love, and we trust in the love he has for us. God is love! Those who are living in love are living in God, and God lives through them."</p>
        
        <p>It's interesting how the devil always throws in a narrative of everything that God does or is. So it's not surprising that the concept of love is not excluded from this attempt at distortion. In the past, the movies and media, in general, sold us a notion that "Love is a feeling." If you didn't feel it, it was probably not valid.</p>
        
        <p>Not long after, there was a new narrative. You'd hear, "Oh, Love is more than a feeling; it is a decision or a choice." But here's the truth: Feelings can fade or be deceptive, and a choice can be influenced by factors to change in the blink of an eye.</p>
        
        <p>What then is the truth? As believers, love for us is our nature. 1 John 4:5,6 rings this truth clearly. God is Love, and if we are born of God, then Love is our nature.</p>
        
        <p>When you received Christ, you received God's love into your heart in never-ending abundance because He put His Spirit in you (Romans 5:5b NIV). We are full and overflowing with God's love. We are dispensers of God's love. There are no exemptions to our expression of love. Colossians 3:14 (MSG) says it's our all-purpose garment.</p>
        
        <p>If you have this revelation of God's love, it will align your understanding of how to love others in return, and you'll be quick to drop like hot potatoes anything that is not consistent with or falls short of your nature.</p>
        
        <p>As a believer, it has become natural to be loving towards people than it is to feel indifference or hatred, and just like God, our love will have no off days.</p>
        
        <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>Does my love mirror the nature and revelation of God's love that I have received?</p>
        
        <h3>CONFESSION</h3>
        <p>I am a dispenser of love. Love is my nature. I walk in Love. I am empowered to love just as Christ does. My love has no off-days.</p>
