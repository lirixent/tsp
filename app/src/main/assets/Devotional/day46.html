    <h1>DAY 46</h1>
    <h2>THE AMNESIA EFFECT</h2>

    <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE:</h3>
    <p><strong>Hebrews 8:12 (NIV)</strong><br>
    "For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more."</p>

    <p>As a child, I always imagined God was in heaven instructing angels to write down every sin I committed. As soon as I told a lie and didn't get a chance to plead for forgiveness, then went on to say a mean word to someone, I imagined my "whiteboard" becoming fuller.</p>

    <p>As I grew older, it became much more difficult to keep track of my sins by myself because I discovered there were sins that I committed knowingly and unknowingly. As we often say, some others were committed just by my thoughts, words, or actions.</p>

    <p>It was impossible to keep up, so I was constantly a guilty person pleading to God to have mercy and forgive me. Once I prayed and felt peaceful, I believed God had instructed an angel to wipe off my whiteboard in preparation for my sins the next day.</p>

    <p>But look at our memory verse today; it says that God does not have a "sinometer" where He records all the wrongdoings of His children. In fact, in Isaiah 38:17, He has cast our sins behind His back! My goodness!</p>

    <p>In 2 Corinthians 5:19, scripture reiterates that God is not instructing an angel to count my sins because long before I was born, He was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself. All the prophets who spoke about the coming of Jesus spoke about God's plan to forget our sins. In Isaiah 43:25, God said, "I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions, for My own sake, and remembers your sins no more."</p
