    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: I Corinthians 15:33 (KJV)</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."</p>
    
    <p>In the journey of faith, our influences play a crucial role in shaping our character and guiding our choices. The apostle Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15:33, warns against the deceptive power of negative influences, emphasizing the importance of guarding our relationships and surroundings to maintain an uncontaminated character.</p>
    
    <p>We live in a world saturated with influences, both positive and negative. Our relationships, the media we consume, and the environments we inhabit all contribute to shaping our character. I Corinthians 15:33 serves as a reminder that the company we keep and the influences we allow into our lives can have a profound impact on the purity of our character.</p>
    
    <p>The verse cautions against being misled, recognizing that bad company has the potential to corrupt good character no matter how "strong" we think we are. As believers, we are called to discern the nature of our associations and evaluate whether our relationships contribute to spiritual growth or pose a risk of contamination. Proverbs 13:20 (NIV) reinforces this idea: "Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm."</p>
    
    <p>In addition to personal relationships, the environments we immerse ourselves in can also influence our character. Whether it be the workplace, social gatherings, or online spaces, we are called to be intentional about the atmospheres we allow into our lives. Maintaining an uncontaminated character involves being vigilant about the influences that surround us.</p>
    
    <p>However, keeping it uncontaminated is not solely about avoiding negative influences; it also involves intentionally cultivating a godly atmosphere. Psalm 1:1-2 (NIV) illustrates the importance of delighting in the law of the Lord and meditating on it day and night. By immersing ourselves in God's Word and surrounding ourselves with positive influences, we contribute to the purity and strength of our character.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>Are there relationships or environments that pose a risk of contaminating my character?</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">CONFESSION</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">I am conscious of my environment and surround myself with people and events that edify me.</p>
