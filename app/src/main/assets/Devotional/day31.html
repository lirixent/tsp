        <h1>LOOK DEEPER FOR MORE</h1>
        <h2>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Romans 5:8-10 (NKJV)</h2>
        <p>"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>The work of salvation was a two-part work, as we see in our text: to save us from sin by His death and to unite us with Him by His resurrected life. Just as His death gave us the assurance of justification and the forgiveness of sin, His resurrection assures us of glorification and eternal life (Romans 6:7-9).</p>

            <p>Paul vividly portrays this image for us, stating that if Christ could overcome the seemingly insurmountable challenge of sin through His death, imagine what His resurrected life can accomplish. This reality applies to our own resurrected life and eternal union with Him.</p>

            <p>When Jesus uttered those words, "It is finished," on the cross, it was truly finished! When He saved us, He saved us completely! He wasn't solely referring to the forgiveness of our sins; He was also addressing something significantâ€”the "joy" that lay before Him. He proclaimed the fulfillment of His purpose, indicating that nothing more would be required. Praise God!</p>

            <p>Christ did not leave the work of our salvation incomplete, expecting us to finish the rest on our own. No, He finished it all. That is why He is referred to as the "author and finisher of our faith" (Hebrews 12:2).</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Are there areas of my life yet to experience the full package of the resurrected life?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>- I have been reconciled to God.<br>- I died with Christ and I was raised with Him.</p>
