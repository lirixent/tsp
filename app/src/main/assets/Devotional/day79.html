    <h2>THE HEART OF TRUE SERVICE</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Peter 4:10 (NIV)</p>
    <p>"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms."</p>

    <p>Why do we serve? What influences our decisions to contribute our time, skills, energy and even finances to the local church? These questions not only reveal the essence of our service but also provide an opportunity for introspection and growth in our walk with God.</p>
    
    <p>If your service is fueled by a genuine passion for the things of God, then you are tapping into a powerful source. Psalm 100:2 (NIV) encourages us to "worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs." A heart ablaze with passion for God's kingdom finds joy and fulfilment in serving. This passion becomes a driving force that transforms routine tasks into acts of worship.</p>
    
    <p>Discovering the needs of the church and stepping forward to address them is another commendable motivation. Galatians 5:13 (NIV) reminds us, "serve one another humbly in love." When we recognize a need and willingly contribute our time and skills, we embody the selfless love that Christ exemplified. Such service becomes a testament to the transformative power of Christ's love working through us.</p>
    
    <p>Beloved, responding to God's call to serve is an act of obedience, aligning our will with His divine purpose. In such service, we become vessels through which God's grace flows to bless others. Regular involvement in service positions us to be consistent stewards of God's grace, impacting lives and contributing to the flourishing of God's house.</p>
    
    <p>If you are not yet serving, the answers to these questions can be a valuable tool for self-evaluation. What might be holding you back? Is it fear, uncertainty, or a lack of understanding of your unique gifts? Allow God to illuminate your path and guide you into a season of purposeful service.</p>
