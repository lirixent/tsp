    <h1 style="text-align: center;">DAY 87<br>TRUST IN THE LORD</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: Proverbs 3:5 (NIV)</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding."</p>
    
    <p>Trust is a foundational element in any relationship, including our relationship with God. It involves a surrendering of our reliance on our own abilities, wisdom, and connections. Proverbs 3:5 calls us to trust in the Lord with all our hearts—not a partial or conditional trust, but a wholehearted reliance on God's guidance, provision, and wisdom.</p>
    
    <p>Human understanding is limited and often influenced by our perspectives and experiences. Leaning on our own understanding can lead to faulty conclusions and decisions. In times of need, the temptation is to rely solely on our capabilities, connections, or worldly wisdom. However, Proverbs 3:5 urges us to resist this temptation and instead lean into God, acknowledging His infinite understanding and wisdom.</p>
    
    <p>The verse implies that God's understanding surpasses our own. Isaiah 55:8-9 (NIV) reinforces this truth: "'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." Trusting in the Lord involves recognizing and embracing the superior wisdom and knowledge that God brings to our circumstances.</p>
    
    <p>In moments of need, our natural inclination might be to turn to our own resources or seek human solutions. Before doing this, our primary posture should be one of trust in God. God's understanding is not confined by human limitations, and His solutions surpass what our finite minds can conceive.</p>
    
    <p>Trusting in the Lord requires a wholehearted surrender—an acknowledgment of our dependence on Him. It involves relinquishing the illusion of self-sufficiency and embracing a posture of humility. Psalm 62:8 (NIV) echoes this sentiment: "Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge."</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>Are there areas of my life where I rely on self or others and not God?</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">CONFESSION</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">I intentionally lean into God for everything.</p>
