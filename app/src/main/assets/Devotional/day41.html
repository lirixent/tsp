        <h2>THE COMPLETE PACKAGE</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: 1 Thessalonians 2:8</h3>
        <p>"So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>As we go about living, there are two general ways we minister the gospel to our world: in our deeds and our words. We either focus our energy entirely on just preaching and teaching the gospel without actually sharing our lives with anyone, or we take the "My life is an example" approach. We say to ourselves, "I am a living epistle after all," and hardly actively preach the gospel.</p>

            <p>Neither of these extremes is fruitful. Focusing only on words is like having a perfect blueprint without an actual building. We must all be on the journey of allowing our lives to mirror and represent the very words we preach. At the same time, we must not hesitate to share the gospel everywhere we find ourselves.</p>

            <p>In our text, Paul expressly says that he not only imparted the gospel in words, but he also shared his life. The ministry of the new covenant does not stop at beautifully preaching Christ; it compels us to also share our lives with the people God has entrusted to us. As the Holy Spirit ministers His love to us, we extend that love to others.</p>

            <p>Sharing our lives means becoming our "Christ-selves." It means expressing the fruit of the Spirit of Christ, putting the needs of others before ours, having genuine heartfelt compassion for people, and loving others as Christ has loved us. At the same time, we must take advantage of every opportunity to proclaim the good news of salvation in its purest form.</p>

            <p>2 Corinthians 2:14 says that because of our victory in Christ, through us, the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ is now spread everywhere. This was how Jesus lived while He walked this earth. And because He is our perfect example of doing and teaching, this is how we pattern our lives.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Am I operating from the extreme of words or deeds? Where do I need to establish the balance?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>I am enriched by Him in all utterance and knowledge.</p>
