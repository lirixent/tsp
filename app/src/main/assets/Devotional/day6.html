        <h1 class="title">DAY 6: WE ARE BLESSED</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Ephesians 1:3 (NIV)</h2>
        <p class="verse">“Praise be to the God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            Acknowledge spiritual blessings require a shift from being sense-ruled to being spirit-ruled. Paul’s prayer for the Ephesians to have the eyes of their heart enlightened emphasizes the need for spiritual insight. As we open our hearts to God’s perspective, we begin to see beyond the limitations of the physical.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The connection between acknowledging spiritual blessings and seeing their materialization is profound. The more we recognize and appreciate what we already have in Christ, the more we witness the manifestation of these blessings in our physical lives. It is a shift from scarcity to abundance, from lack to overflow.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Let our praise be grounded in the understanding that we have been blessed in Christ Jesus with every spiritual blessing. As we acknowledge these blessings, our worship becomes a response to the richness of God’s grace and the completeness we have in Him.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Recognizing our spiritual blessings transforms our perspective of life. It shapes how we navigate challenges, make decisions, and interact with others. The richness of our spiritual blessings influences the materialization of abundance, provision, and favor in our physical circumstances.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            As you lift your praise to God today, remember that you are blessed in Christ Jesus with every spiritual blessing and the completeness you have in Him. Acknowledge and appreciate these spiritual blessings you already have in Christ.
