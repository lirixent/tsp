        <h1 class="title">DAY 7: PRAYER - THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Ephesians 1:17 (NIV)</h2>
        <p class="verse">“I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            In Ephesians 1:17, the apostle Paul offers a powerful prayer for believers, expressing a deep desire for the Spirit of wisdom and revelation to illuminate the knowledge of the Lord. The knowledge of the Lord surpasses mere intellectual understanding; it involves a profound and intimate connection with the heart of God. Ephesians 1:17 implies a desire for believers to experience a deep, personal, and transformative knowledge of God. This knowledge is not static but dynamic, continually growing as we engage in a vibrant relationship with Him.

            Paul’s prayer highlights the role of the Spirit of wisdom in deepening our knowledge of God. Through prayer, we invite the Holy Spirit to impart wisdom—an understanding that goes beyond human reasoning and delves into the mysteries of God. James 1:5 (NIV) encourages us, “If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.”

            The ultimate goal of deepening our knowledge of the Lord is to know Him better. Prayer is the avenue through which we draw near to God, seeking His face and desiring intimacy with Him. Philippians 3:10 (NIV) captures this yearning: “I want to know Christ – Yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death.”
