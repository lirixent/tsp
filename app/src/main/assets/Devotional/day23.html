        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Romans 12:2 (TPT)</h2>
        <p class="verse">“Stop imitating the ideals and opinions of the culture around you but be inwardly transformed by the Holy Spirit through a total reformation of how you think. This will empower you to discern God's will as you live a beautiful life, satisfying and perfect in his eyes.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            In our text today, Paul presents the idea that there are two options: the Christ narrative or the world's narrative that pulls at the attention of the believer across every area of our lives. Sometimes, the world is constantly pushing a narrative that is opposed to the Christ narrative.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The message of Scripture strongly opposes the world's narrative. 2 Corinthians 10:5 speaks of casting down thought patterns that exalt themselves against the knowledge of Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The truth is, many times, the conversations you have or movies you see is a campaign. It's a call to vote. To decide which reality to uphold between the narrative of the world's system or the narrative of Christ. And so, there is no fence for the believer.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The believer has a responsibility to renew his/her mind. Continuously. (Ephesians 4:23 AMPC) This will help us guard against imbibing what the world's narrative is promoting, no matter how normal it seems. Colossians 2:9 says, "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Colossians 3:9-14 (MSG) says we have a new custom-made attire that is better than the ill-fitting clothes of the former culture and world system. As a new man in Christ, our new attire is the all-purpose garment of Love.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Dear believer, the mind of Christ is your voter's card. It is your deliberate choice to reflect the character of Christ rather than the character of culture in your daily experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Let your vote represent your identity in Christ.
