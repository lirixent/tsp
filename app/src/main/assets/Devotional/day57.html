        <h1>DAY 57</h1>
        <h2>THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT</h2>
        <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: John 3:16</h3>
        <p>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."</p>
        
        <p>When scripture says - God "so" loved, it tells you the degree to which God loved us, a degree that words can't really articulate. I John 3:1 calls us to behold and look with wonder at the love we've been loved with.</p>
        
        <p>If we break down our text today into keywords (highlighted in block letters), here's what we will find; "For <strong>GOD</strong> so <strong>LOVED</strong> the <strong>WORLD</strong> that <strong>HE GAVE</strong> His only begotten <strong>SON</strong>."</p>
        
        <p>The keywords show us the following;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Love</strong> - The ultimate expression</li>
            <li><strong>God</strong> - The giver</li>
            <li><strong>World</strong> - The deficit</li>
            <li><strong>His Son</strong> - The gift</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>There was a real deficit that the human condition was helpless to fix and on account of this, we were doomed to eternal destruction. But God stepped in and gave the gift of Jesus as a sacrifice. You should read Romans 8:3-4 in the Message version to see how it describes this.</p>
        
        <p>The real gift to our world is the giving of Jesus, but in addition, it is also the gift of Sonship. By the giving of Jesus, God's only begotten Son, many more sons (You and I) have now come to God! (Romans 8:29, John 1:12.) What a gift! A love that reproduces just by its expression. Hallelujah!</p>
        
        <p>Guess what? That same love is the love that you've received to give out. (I John 4:12,19). Your love should be a gift to this world. That by expressing and completing the love you have received, either by behavior or word or presence, the fragrance of Christ spreads and draws others to Him.</p>
        
        <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>Is my love giving in nature? What gift does my love give?</p>
        
        <h3>CONFESSION</h3>
        <p>God's love gift has set a chain reaction in motion that causes me to be transformed and to experience all the realities of sonship.</p>
