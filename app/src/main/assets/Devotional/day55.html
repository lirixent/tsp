        <h1>DAY 55</h1>
        <h2>LOVE NEVER FAILS</h2>
        <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Corinthians 13:8a</h3>
        <p>"Love never fails."</p>
        
        <p>How can the character of love be unfailing? To never fail means to never break a promise, to never miss an appointment, to never fail to fulfill an obligation, and to never fall short of an expectation, regardless of the circumstances. Doesn't it feel incredibly satisfying and fulfilling to be loved in this way?</p>
        
        <p>It's evident that someone capable of such love must be a perfect person in every sense of the word. It's truly satisfying to know that someone so flawless loves you.</p>
        
        <p>Receiving this kind of love brings a heightened sense of rest, security, and assurance. You just know that you will never be disappointed, and your desires and expectations will always be met.</p>
        
        <p>By now, you might have realized that only God can never fail, while our human nature disqualifies us. The Bible states in 1 John 4:7 that God is love. This love of God is personified in the life of Jesus Christ. Christ never failed and will never fail. He fulfilled His mission on the cross, rose again, and now lives eternally to ensure the fulfillment of His promise of eternal redemption.</p>
        
        <p>Jesus says, "Love one another as I have loved you." In other words, the only way we can truly love is by first opening our hearts to receive the never-ending, never-failing love of Christ.</p>
        
        <p>If this unfailing character of love is expressed only by God and embodied in the person of Jesus, then we are not expected to love in our own strength because, in reality, we cannot.</p>
        
        <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>How can I receive the love of Christ today?</p>
        
        <h3>CONFESSION</h3>
        <p>Because God's love for me can never fail or disappoint me, I am confident in my expectation of good. I am empowered to love just as Christ does.</p>
