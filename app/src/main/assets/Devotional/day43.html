        <h1>DAY 43</h1>
        <h2>HONOURABLE LEGISLATORS</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Proverbs 18:21 (AMPC)</h3>
        <p>"Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they who indulge in it shall eat the fruit of it [for death or life]."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>As a believer, you hold the honorable office of a legislator in your spiritual constituency. To legislate simply means to bind, to put or hold together, or to put into law. Your government (heaven) has given you the power to cause things to happen when you open your mouth. Just like the legislators in your natural government can make new laws and change existing laws, you too can do that in the spirit and watch it manifest in the physical.</p>

            <p>In John 16:7, when Jesus told His disciples that He had to leave, He said it was for their benefit and ours by extension. His ascendance to heaven was to give you the power to legislate freely in your domain.</p>

            <p>Here is what God has said to you in Matthew 18:18 AMPC: Whatever you forbid and declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is already forbidden in heaven. Whatever you permit and declare proper and lawful on earth must be what is already permitted in heaven.</p>

            <p>When there is a situation in your domain, you are the representative there to fix it. You can lay hands on the sick to receive healing, you can speak to the clouds to make it rain, and you can announce the order of things and make them happen. You can speak into your life and see positive results. Heaven agrees with you!</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Have I been serving in my office as a legislator?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>I exercise the authority I have been given to change situations; I speak and things turn around.</p>
