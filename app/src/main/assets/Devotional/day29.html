        <h1>DAY 29</h1>
        <h2>GIVING IS A RESPONSE</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: 2 Corinthians 9:8 (AMPC)</h3>
        <p>"And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need, be self-sufficient, possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Very often, the process of transformation in the area of giving or loving will start from the point where you don't feel like it to where it becomes normalâ€”a spontaneous action. This is because living out our Christ life is a full circle. It starts with what Christ did for you and then reaches the point where you do the same for others because of what Christ did for you.</p>

            <p>So why do we give? Because there's nothing we have that He didn't give us! Romans 8:32 says He gave Jesus and can also give us all things freely. The Christ way gives bountifully. There was no guarantee that after Jesus gave His life and took our place, we would love Him back. Yet He did it anyway. Romans 3:24 says He freely gives away His righteousness.</p>

            <p>According to scripture, the unit of measurement for giving bountifully or sparingly is not in the amount. So, one person can give N500, and it is considered bountiful giving, while another person gives the same N500, and it is considered sparingly.</p>

            <p>Giving bountifully is a state of your heart. Giving bountifully means giving cheerfully, not as though you are at a loss (2 Corinthians 9:6-7). Just as the ATM is programmed to give because funds have been supplied, your giving is a deliberate response to the revelation of how much God has already given you.</p>

            <p>And if God would not give anything less than Christ because Christ is a representation of Him, you too can give from a place of value.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>How can my giving reflect the mind of Christ that I now have?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>I am a channel and give valuable gifts.</p>
