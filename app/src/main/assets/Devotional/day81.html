    <h1 style="text-align: center;">DAY 81<br>EMBRACE YOUR IDENTITY</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: John 1:12</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name."</p>
    
    <p>Having the mind of Christ is an advantage to every believer and this can be broken down into three categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Identity</strong> - Your position in Christ</li>
        <li><strong>Your Transformation</strong> - The Holy Spirit's work in you</li>
        <li><strong>Your Expression</strong> - Living out your new identity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>One thing that's worthy of note is transformation doesn't happen before identity in this kingdom. Unlike the world, where you may need to undergo a transformation or change process before being labelled with an identity, for us in Christ, we start out with an identity. That identity is who you are in Christ, and everything else flows from there.</p>
    
    <p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says that anyone who is in Christ is a new creation. According to our text today, you were called God's son immediately upon becoming born-again, not the moment you began to behave like a son of God. When this reality sinks deeply, it becomes the measuring scale against which you weigh everything that enters through your ears or eyes.</p>
    
    <p>Because you have received an identity, you then begin to behave in a manner that reflects that identity. You start to behave as sons do. Think of it as being born into your biological family, where by virtue of your identity in that family, you begin to behave like them.</p>
    
    <p>As sons, we come to the knowledge of our identity through God's Word; hence it is crucial never to lose sight of the truth of God's Word regarding our identity. Instead, we must let it dwell richly within us (Colossians 3:16). You started out with an identity; stick with it!</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>Is my report or perception of situations in line with the truth of my identity or what I am seeing/hearing/feeling?</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">CONFESSION</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">All that this identity in Christ encompasses is my experience.</p>
