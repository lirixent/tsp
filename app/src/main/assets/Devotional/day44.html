    <h1>DAY 44</h1>
    <h2>BLOOD AUTHORIZED</h2>

    <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE:</h3>
    <p><strong>Revelation 1:5-6</strong><br>
    "...and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."</p>

    <p>In the old Nigerian movies, when someone wanted to gain wealth or influence in a struggle for power, the herbalist or witch doctor often required an animal sacrifice. This blood offering was believed to tip the scales of power.</p>

    <p><strong>As a believer, do you realize what has happened to you?</strong> Revelation 5:12 states that the Lamb was slain to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing. What a rich buffet!</p>

    <p>The sacrifice of Jesus is the greatest ever offered. Unlike previous sacrifices that required repetition, Hebrews 10:12 assures us that Jesus’ sacrifice was once and for all. Furthermore, Hebrews 12:24 emphasizes that His blood speaks better promises than Abel’s.</p>

    <p>The forgiveness of sin you received (Ephesians 1:7) doesn't just erase sin; it restores you to your original position—and even beyond—before Adam fell. You were created in His image, but now you are seated with Him (Ephesians 2:6).</p>

    <p>Dear believer, you now operate from the dimension where God is! Colossians 2:9-10 reveals that the fullness of God dwells in Christ, who is the head over every authority or ruler. Being in complete union with Christ means you share the same authority over every power on earth, sea, air—whatever it may be.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <strong>REFLECTION</strong><br>
        How will I live knowing that my union with Christ grants me influence over life?
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <strong>CONFESSION</strong><br>
        I walk in the BETTER benefits and results that my blood sacrifice promises.
    </div>
