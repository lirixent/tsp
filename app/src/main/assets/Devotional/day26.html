        <h1>DAY 26</h1>
        <h2>THE FRUIT-BEARING BELIEVER</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: John 15:1,4</h3>
        <p>"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>It’s ironic that people often claim that change is a constant in life, yet simultaneously argue that people don’t change. As believers, however, we recognize an essential truth: every believer undergoes a transformation from their old nature to a new nature, entirely through the influence of the Holy Spirit received upon being born again (Ephesians 1:13).</p>

            <p>In Matthew 7:16, Scripture states, "By their fruit, you shall know them." This conveys a simple message: just as a mango tree cannot bear apple fruit, the old nature of sin cannot produce the fruits of righteousness. If we affirm that a believer has been resurrected into new life and has experienced a rebirth (see Galatians 2:20, Colossians 3:3, Galatians 5:24), then the only fruits that can manifest from that person are those characteristic of their new nature in Christ.</p>

            <p>This leads us to the question: Where are your new, fresh fruits? The truth is, God doesn’t require fruit to know you, but the world does. The light we are called to shine is not for God's benefit, but for others to witness and glorify Him (Matthew 5:16). As new creations, we must willingly relinquish the familiarity of our old lives (old fruit), which has been crucified (Romans 6:6).</p>

            <p>Ultimately, when people taste the new fruit you are producing and compare it to the old fruit they once experienced, they can testify that it is indeed possible for a person to change through the saving power of Christ.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>What areas of my life need to taste like the new fruit of Christ?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>The fruits of the gospel are seen in me everywhere I go.</p>
