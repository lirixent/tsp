    <h1>DAY 70</h1>
    <h2>PROMISE OF PEACE</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: Isaiah 54:10 (GNB)</p>
    <p>"The mountains and hills may crumble, but my love for you will never end; I will keep forever my promise of peace." So says the LORD who loves you.</p>

    <p>I have come to learn that the love we have received in Christ is rich in ways that we may never be able to articulate. It is so deep, so wide, so highâ€”it goes on and on.</p>

    <p>One of the dividends of this love is peace which is in two folds. Peace with God as a result of Jesus' sacrifice that reconciled us back to Him (2 Corinthians 5:19; Romans 5:1), and peace from God to navigate life's circumstances (Philippians 4:7; Romans 16:20).</p>

    <p>You see, for the believer, peace is not determined by calmness or the absence of chaos. The origin of your peace is because of the Father's love for you that was revealed on the cross.</p>

    <p>In John 20:19-20, when Jesus dropped in on His disciples after He rose, the first thing He did was proclaim, "Peace be unto you," and then showed them His hands and His side as proof that it was He who died, was buried, and rose again. His appearance after the resurrection was proof that the fight for their peace was over. He took away every reason to fear. God's love now gives us peace about our past, present, and future. No more fear!</p>

    <p>Our text today is a powerful assurance for us. God says that even if mountains crumble and earthquakes destroy everything, His love for us will never end, and He will forever keep His promise of peace. In other words, love promises peace. And when God makes a promise, you can be sure He is not a man who would lie. Love keeps its promise.</p>
