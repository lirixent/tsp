        <h1>DAY 47 - THE IMMORTALS</h1>
        <h2>Key Scripture/Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>Hebrews 2:14-15<br>
        "Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."</p>

        <p>One of the greatest fruits of being saved and having an understanding of the gospel is the total elimination of fear. That feeling that nothing in this world can affect you, overcome you, or have any ultimate impact on you.</p>

        <p>Fear is a crippler that makes you believe God's promises are impossible, and the devil's plans are possible. The highest level of fear is the fear of death. This fear, as the text states, is what the devil has used to keep so many people in bondage.</p>

        <p>Let me explain how this fear works. It starts by painting a vivid picture of the terror, suffering, and pain that comes with physical death and continues into eternity. Then comes the lie that we can do nothing about this. This leaves us helpless and weak, feeling inadequate to approach God, feeling unworthy of believing in and subsequently receiving and experiencing His promises for us.</p>

        <p>But thanks be to God! All of this was completely and eternally dealt with when Jesus took on flesh like us, died, and rose again, thereby showing that death had no power to actualize the pictures of eternal suffering. Rather, the exact opposite happens. Jesus showed us that death is only a window to eternal joy and union with Him for all who put their faith in Him.</p>

        <p>Beloved, the greatest evil—death—has no power over you. What more can stop you?</p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>How would I live my life knowing that nothing can stop me?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="declaration">
            <h2>Declaration</h2>
            <p>I have received eternal life. Death and the fear of death have lost their influence over me.</p>
