        <h1>DAY 42</h1>
        <h2>OUR TESTIMONY</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Revelations 12:10-11</h3>
        <p>"Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, 'Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.'</p>

            <p>One of my favorite sports is boxing. In boxing, the fight does not start in the ring; it starts way before. You will constantly see boxers talking to each other, saying things to each other directly and indirectly and trying to psych each other out. This is because they know that if they can get into the head, the actual fight will be easier to win.</p>

            <p>This is how the devil operates: he starts to do evil by engineering accusations and condemnations. His target is your heart and mind; his weapon is accusation and condemnation. The purpose is to bring doubt and fear.</p>

            <p>In 1 Peter 1:8, Scripture says that Satan is "looking for whom to devour." He will only strike after he has been able to affect your mind with accusations and condemnations, thereby separating you from the consciousness of your superior reality.</p>

            <p>As a wise believer, you must sever yourself from accusations. You must remember Romans 8:1, which says, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." Isaiah 54:17 says, "And every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn." How do you condemn? Our text says "by our testimony." Our testimony is declaring the victory of Jesus, declaring victory over sin, victory over sickness, victory over calamities, victory over infirmities.</p>

            <p>You always have victory! You are a child of God, and the Godhead is headquartered inside you. Nothing can suppress you! Those who put their trust in the Lord cannot be put to shame!</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Am I deliberate about affirming my testimony? How can I win over condemnation?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>Because Christ dwells in me, I am victorious always.</p>
