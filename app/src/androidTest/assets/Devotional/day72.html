    <h1>DAY 72</h1>
    <h2>GREEN-EYED OR CHRIST-EYED?</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Corinthians 3:3</p>
    <p>"For you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men?"</p>

    <p>Looking at our text today, Paul says here that the expression of envy, strife, and contention points to carnality. In other words, it reflects immaturity and self-centeredness in the life of a believer. As we established some days ago, self is not love; there is no room for it. In fact, anyone who truly expresses love cannot be self-seeking.</p>

    <p>For the believer, the expression of envy is essentially a return to living as a mere human. And we know that Scripture tells us that if anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). New creation! This means that the old self is no longer present. Christ is now your life! (Colossians 3:4)</p>

    <p>You must understand that envy is the work of the devil and arises from an insecure mind. If you know the source of love you have received and believe that it already covers you, then there is no need to feel insecure or threatened by the achievements or experiences of your neighbor or friend.</p>

    <p>Guess what? Sometimes, your natural self, your ego, may actually feel envious of someone. However, instead of dwelling in that state or succumbing to condemnation, you can shift your focus and think about how love perceives that situation. And how does love perceive goodness? Love rejoices at the blessing(s) of others.</p>

    <p>As the beings of love that we are, we see and respond to the successes of others through different perspectives. Our perspectives have changed from a self-centered viewpoint to a Christ-centered one.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Do I give in to self or to the Spirit of love in my response to the successes or results of others?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I instruct my heart to always respond through the lens of love which is to rejoice.</p>
    </div>
