        <h1>DAY 61</h1>
        <h2>HOW MUCH CAN I BEAR?</h2>
        <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: I Corinthians 13:7</h3>
        <p><em>"bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."</em></p>

        <p>Do you ever ask yourself, "How much can I really bear? How much disappointment, hate, hurt, abuse, offence, attack, and even persecution can I endure and for how long?" Is there a point where it becomes too much to take, where we lose the ability and willingness to love because of one reason or another? I think it is easy to answer yes if we are looking at our human nature.</p>

        <p>Today's text says, "Love bears all things." This is an absolute statement that leaves no room for any exceptions. Love is so strong that it can withstand any kind of pressure. It is so wide that it can accommodate any hurt or disappointment, regardless of the gravity.</p>

        <p>This characteristic of love is critical because without it, love won't last long. And we know that the love of Christ did. Jesus was only able to finish the work of the cross because He could bear all things to the point of death, including death itself.</p>

        <p>This is why Paul could say in Romans 8:38-39, "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."</p>

        <p>Dear believer, we are blessed to be beneficiaries of this love. Not only that, we have also received the capacity to love in the same way.</p>

        <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>Do I think there's a limit to how much pressure or offence I can take?</p>

        <h3>CONFESSION</h3>
        <p>I walk in the revelation of my ability to always respond like Christ. Daily, I am yielded to the power of God's love in me to always win offence by love.</p>
