        <h1 class="title">DAY 13: PRAYER - FOR GODLY LIVING</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: 2 Corinthians 13:7 (NIV)</h2>
        <p class="verse">“Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            The desire for godly living goes beyond external actions; it involves an internal transformation of the heart and mind. In prayer, we invite the Holy Spirit to work within us, shaping our desires and motivations to align with God's will. Romans 12:2 (NIV) encourages us, “Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”

            This prayer is important because living righteously will not be accomplished by the flesh or human effort. However, through prayer, we seek the strength to do what is right even in the face of difficulties. James 1:5 (NIV) reminds us to ask God for wisdom when facing trials: “If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.”

        <p class="content">
            The motivation for godly living is not to gain approval from others or even God but to express who God has made us—holy people (Col 1:22). When we live holy, people can see God in us, and God is glorified.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Godly living is a journey of spiritual maturity. In prayer, we ask for the grace to grow in our understanding of who we are in Christ to live holy lives. Hebrews 5:13 (NIV) speaks of spiritual maturity: “Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.”
