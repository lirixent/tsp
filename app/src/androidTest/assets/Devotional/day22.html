        <h1 class="title">DAY 22: PERFECTED IN CHRIST</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Matthew 5:48 AMP</h2>
        <p class="verse">“You, therefore, will be perfect [growing into spiritual maturity both in mind and character, actively integrating godly values into your daily life], as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            How many times have you been hit with the phrase, "Nobody is perfect," the moment you question a believer's inability to express a nature or character that scripture urges them to? Too often? Not regularly? Once in a blue moon?
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            You see, in the translation of our text today, the word "perfect" is a Greek word, <em>teleios</em>, which is used to refer more to maturity, wholeness, or completeness. Doesn't scripture say we are already complete in Christ? (Colossians 2:10)
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            In essence, Jesus was saying to us in Matthew, "You should be who you are!" The man who is in Christ has been perfected in Christ. Hallelujah! So the exhortation to be perfect isn't to be something that's not in your nature.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Isn't it interesting that 1 John 4:17, in speaking about completeness and, by extension, perfection, says that love is perfected and made complete in us because just as He is, so are we?
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            What Jesus is saying in Matthew 5 is about the law and what He had come to do for us. In verse 17, He said He came to complete and fulfill the law so that we would never try to attain acceptance and perfection before God based on certain moral or religious standards.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Dear believer, perfection is possible because you are perfect solely on the premise of what Christ has done.
        </p>
        <h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
        <p class="content">Have I ever said I'm not perfect to escape accountability?</p>
        <h3 class="confession">Confession</h3>
        <p class="content"><strong>The perfected love of the Father is expressed through me daily. I am perfected in Christ.</strong></p>
