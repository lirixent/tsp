        <h1 class="title">DAY 15: PRAYER - FOR BELIEVERS TO BE IN ONE ACCORD</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Romans 15:5-6 (NIV)</h2>
        <p class="verse">“May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            In Romans 15:5-6, Paul's prayer beautifully expresses a desire for Christians to be in one accord, sharing a unified mind and voice that glorifies God. Paul begins by acknowledging that endurance and encouragement come from God. In prayer, we recognize our dependence on God's strength to navigate the challenges of living in harmony with fellow believers. Philippians 2:1-2 (NIV) encourages a shared mindset: “Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind.”

            The ultimate goal of being in one accord is to glorify God with one mind and one voice. In prayer, we express our desire for unity, recognizing that it is a testimony to the transforming power of God's love. Psalm 133:1 (NIV) beautifully illustrates the blessing of unity: “How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity!”

            Differences in perspectives, preferences, and personalities can challenge unity. Through prayer, we seek God's grace to overcome these differences, fostering an atmosphere of love, understanding, and acceptance. Colossians 3:14 (NIV) encourages us to put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.

            Prayer becomes a vehicle for mutual edification within the body of Christ. As we pray for one another, we contribute to the spiritual growth and well-being of the entire family of God. Ephesians 4:16 (NIV) speaks of the importance of each part working together: “From him, the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.”
