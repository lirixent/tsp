    <h1>DAY 73</h1>
    <h2>GROWING UP IS NECESSARY</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Corinthians 3:1,2 (NLT)</p>
    <p>"Dear brothers and sisters, when I was with you I couldn't talk to you as I would to spiritual people. I had to talk as though you belonged to this world or as though you were infants in Christ. I had to feed you with milk, not with solid food, because you weren't ready for anything stronger. And you still aren't ready."</p>

    <p>One of the lessons that stands out the most from our study these past few weeks is that love is spiritual. That is, it is a working of the Spirit and the nature of God. And if you have received this love, it should naturally translate into producing love in you by the Spirit.</p>

    <p>The question is, what then should be the result in our lives and relationships? Love actually demands growth. In fact, the fruit of the Spirit in you is essentially a pull to demonstrate love (Galatians 5:22-25). It is a call to step up to your true identity. If you think about it, is there a loving parent who would be happy to see his/her child not growing or not acting in ways that come from love? How then do you think that God, who is love, does not desire or expect you to make progress and grow in your love walk?</p>

    <p>Paul's relationship with the church in Corinth is a prime example of how disheartening it is when we are not growing. He had visited them a number of times, and in fact, during his first visit, he taught the gospel wholeheartedly for about 18 months, laboring over them despite the discouragement he faced. But what result does he get? One year after he leaves, it is glaringly obvious that they still hadn't grown. They were still carnal, expressing emotions and actions that didn't mirror the nature of love. Yesterday, we saw in verse 3 of our text that he described them as living like mere men.</p>

    <p>Today, love is placing a demand on you to rise to the fullness of who you really are. And love won't stop laboring.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Does my character reflect the truth of my spiritual nature or carnality?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>By the help of the Holy Spirit, I rise to the demand of the Spirit of love at work in me and I produce good works.</p>
    </div>
