        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Ephesians 5:18-21</h2>
        <p class="verse">“And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another in the fear of God.”</p>

            Every time we saw people filled with the Holy Spirit, it always led to a corresponding action. They either prophesied, spoke in tongues, rejoiced, spoke the word of God in boldness, and more. In our text for today, a very intriguing comparison is made between being drunk with wine and being filled with the Spirit. Being drunk with wine takes deliberate effort, and that's how being constantly filled with the Holy Spirit happens.

            At the new birth, we receive the Holy Spirit. However, "to be filled" with the Holy Spirit requires daily consciousness and consistency. Just as one can't be drunk with the wine that one had last week, we can only be filled with the Spirit by constantly yielding our hearts in prayer, His word, songs, and more.

            When you are full of the Spirit, you will overpower the works of the flesh. You can't be filled with the Spirit and be depressed or sorrowful. When you are filled with the Holy Spirit, your view, countenance, and character will be Spirit-inspired.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Being filled with the Holy Spirit does not mean having more of Him, but rather the Holy Spirit having more of you. You can tell when you are in control and when the Holy Spirit is. There is nothing God requires you to do that you will do effectively when you do it from the flesh. It must be of the Spirit to be effective. You can't express Jesus from the flesh. Christ can't be known from the place of the flesh. Galatians 5:16 tells us: “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.”
