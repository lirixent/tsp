        <h1>DAY 2</h1>
        <p class="introduction">HE CALLS ME RIGHTEOUS</p>
        <h2>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 2 Corinthians 5:21 (NIV)</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Through the sacrificial work of Jesus, God reconciled us to Himself. The separation caused by sin was bridged on the cross, and God’s righteous anger towards sinners was replaced with His loving embrace. The death of Jesus was the ultimate act of reconciliation, making a way for us to be restored to a right relationship with the Father.</p>
        <p>Our righteousness is not a result of our deeds, past, present, or future. Just as Jesus, who knew no sin, became sin for us on the cross, we in turn became the righteousness of God in Him (2 Corinthians 5:21). The divine exchange is a gift that transcends our efforts; it is a declaration of our new identity in Christ.</p>
        <p>Understanding our right standing with the Father transforms our experiences. God no longer sees us through the lenses of our failures but through the finished work of Jesus. To view yourself otherwise would be unjust in the eyes of God. Embrace the truth that God now calls you righteous.</p>
        <p>Acceptance of your righteous identity is crucial to living a life aligned with God’s truth. It is not about what you have done or will do but about what Jesus has accomplished on your behalf. Today, make a conscious decision to accept the righteousness that God freely offers.</p>
        <p>Your consciousness of being righteous in Christ shapes your reality. As you become more aware of this identity, it influences your thoughts, attitudes, and actions. Romans 12:1 (NIV): “Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God – this is your true and proper worship.” It is in view of the mercy we have already received that we live right.</p>
        <p>Daily remind yourself that God calls you righteous. Your identity is not determined by your past or your actions but by the finished work of Jesus.</p>
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Am I conscious of my righteous identity?</p>
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
