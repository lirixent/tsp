        <h1>DAY 59</h1>
        <h2>WINNING AGAINST OFFENCE</h2>
        <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: Romans 2:4 (NKJV)</h3>
        <p>"Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?"</p>
        
        <p>In 1 John 3:14, it states that we know we have transitioned from spiritual death to spiritual life because of our love. How can we identify if someone is born again? How can we determine if someone is saved? It is through their display of love. The Spirit of Christ permeates their actions, and when people interact with them, they can observe their loving response, which stems from their Christ-like nature.</p>
        
        <p>However, love is not something trivial or superficial. Love is a commitment of the heart, something that requires genuine devotion. In fact, love requires submission. Let me explain why I use the term "submission." Often, there is a conflict between what love dictates and what our personal desires urge us to do. These two responses can be different. While we may want to act according to our own desires, knowing what love would do, we choose to submit and follow the path of love.</p>
        
        <p>I acknowledge that when dealing with offences, there is a place for correction without a doubt. In fact, Scripture affirms that the Father corrects those whom He loves (Hebrews 12:6). However, it is crucial to discern between a rebuke motivated by love, which leads to growth, and a supposed love response that aims to justify our own natural inclinations. In our passage, the reference to the riches of God's goodness actually pertains to love. When love encounters offence, what does it do? Love seeks to restore the offender.</p>
        
        <p>Just like Jesus won you over, He persisted in demonstrating His goodness until you were convicted and surrendered to Him. His goodness softened your heart, leading you to repentance. To resolve conflicts with someone who has wronged you, the key is to approach them with love. Although it may seem tempting to make the offence an issue in the hope that the offender will express remorse (which is what you truly desire), it is love that will ultimately bring about this change. Pursuing reconciliation requires reaching out to the one who has offended you with genuine love and compassion.</p>
        
        <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>In my response to offences, do I reduce my love standard or operate from my love standard?</p>
        
        <h3>DECLARATION</h3>
        <p>I go the way of love and win by love.</p>
