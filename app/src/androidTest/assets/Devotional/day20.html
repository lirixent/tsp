        <h1 class="title">DAY 20: BOLDNESS ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: 1 John 4:17</h2>
        <p class="verse">“In this world, we are like Jesus. There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            The scripture declares that in this world, we are like Jesus. As believers, we share in His righteousness and have been made new creations. This likeness to Christ grants us boldness on the day of judgment, knowing that His finished work on the cross has secured our standing before God.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The foundation of our boldness lies in the absence of fear, and love plays a pivotal role. Perfect love, exemplified through Christ's sacrificial death, drives out fear. Our sins, past, present, and future, have been judged on the cross, and this perfect love eliminates any apprehension of punishment.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Understanding that our sins have already been judged on the cross brings a profound shift in perspective. The day of judgment is not a cause for fear but a celebration of the redemption and righteousness secured through Christ. The believer stands in the assurance that the penalty for sin has been paid in full.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Fear in the face of judgment indicates an incomplete understanding of God's perfect love. As we embrace the truth that our sins have been judged on the cross, we become recipients of the perfected love that casts out fear. The journey to perfection in love involves trusting in the completeness of Christ's redemptive work.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Carry the awareness that your sins have been judged on the cross. Let this truth anchor your boldness on the day of judgment, knowing that perfect love has cast out fear. Embrace the likeness to Jesus that grants you confidence and stand in the assurance that, through Christ, you are made perfect in love.
