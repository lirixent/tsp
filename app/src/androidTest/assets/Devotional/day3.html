        <h2>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 John 2:2 (NIV)</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“He is the atoning sacrifice of our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The term “Propitiation” signifies appeasement, gaining favor, or acting as a substitute. In the context of our faith, it represents Christ’s role as our substitute, taking upon Himself the wrath of God due to our sins. Through His sacrifice, Jesus appeased divine justice and secured favor for us.</p>
        <p>As our substitute, Jesus bore the weight of God’s wrath on the cross. The sins that rightfully deserved punishment were placed upon Him. This act of substitution made forgiveness available to us. The depth of God’s love is manifested in Christ’s willingness to stand in our place.</p>
        <p>The scope of God’s forgiveness extends beyond Christians; it encompasses the entire world. The sacrifice of Jesus is not limited; it is a provision for the sins of humanity. God, in His boundless mercy, made a way for every person to receive forgiveness.</p>
        <p>While forgiveness is provided to the whole world, receiving it is a personal journey (Acts 26:18). The provision is based on the finished work of Jesus, but appropriation occurs through faith. It’s not merely acknowledging that forgiveness exists; it’s putting faith in the one who provided it—Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>The culmination of understanding propitiation and receiving forgiveness is a resounding expression of gratitude. Glory to God for providing a way to reconcile sinful humanity to Himself. Your sins are forgiven because of the finished work of Christ on the cross.</p>
        <p>Today, you stand forgiven. The assurance of forgiveness is not rooted in your actions or merit but in the completed work of Jesus. Rejoice in the reality that your sins, past, present, and future, are forgiven, and we have access to this reality by faith in Christ.</p>
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>How does knowing that my sins are forgiven influence my walk with God?</p>
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>Through Christ, my sins are forgiven.</p>
