    <h2>ALL GOD'S FAVOURITES</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: Romans 2:11 (AMPC)</p>
    <p>"For God shows no partiality undue favour or unfairness; with Him one man is not different from another."</p>

    <p>Ever felt that God has favourites? The feeling that others are living a better life than you are? While you may be tempted to think this way, we must remember that we are equally loved by God.</p>
    
    <p>It is essential for every believer to know and understand that the things that happen to us or for us are not the primary proof of God's love. Only one thing defines essentially God's love for us: the CROSS!</p>
    
    <p>In Romans 5:8 Paul says, "Christ proved God's passionate love for us by dying in our place while we were still lost and ungodly." God proved His love for the WHOLE WORLD, not just a select few, through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross (John 3:16). He demonstrated that we all made it on the list of those He loved when He died for all of us. I John 3:16 says we know real love because Jesus gave up His life for us.</p>
    
    <p>We are not to measure God's love for us by material things. So God doesn't love someone else more than He loves you because that person has more material blessings than you do. Those are not the yardstick for measuring God's love for you. Rather, we see God's love through the cross. The more you dwell on this truth, every wrong idea that suggests God doesn't love you will be torn down.</p>
    
    <p>Let your heart be filled with this understanding daily that God takes delight in you, and even if you were the only one on earth, He would still prove His love by dying for you. You are just as loved by Him as anyone else.</p>

        <p>How do I feel about those things that seem to be working out for others but not for me? Does God love me on the same level as He does others?</p>
