        <h1>DAY 58</h1>
        <h2>490 TIMES</h2>
        <h3>KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Peter 4:8 (AMPC)</h3>
        <p>"Above all things have intense and unfailing love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins (forgives and disregards the offenses of others)."</p>
        
        <p>'Four hundred and ninety times'â€”that's the number of times Jesus gave as the answer to Peter's question when he asked how often he should forgive his brother's offense (Matthew 18:22).</p>
        
        <p>If you consider the number of hours you're probably awake in the day, say 16 hours perhaps, and you divide 490 times into 16 places, it comes down to forgiving every 2 minutes. Does this mean Jesus actually expected him (and by extension, us) to forgive every 2 minutes? Yes!</p>
        
        <p>Beloved, forgiveness is in your character as a believer to give. Why? God's love is displayed in His forgiveness. Even when we were under the destructive influence of our wrongdoings, He forgave us and rescued us from that influence by giving us new life in Christ (Ephesians 2:4,5).</p>
        
        <p>In Romans 5:1-5, Scripture says the gift of our justification by faith causes us to have peace with God. The peace here refers to reconciliation, i.e., He forgave us and restored our relationship with Him. And because of this, we have confident hope that we are saved. It's a hope that will not disappoint, no matter what we go through or how many times we fall because God's love has been given to us through the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        
        <p>A lot of people love when they have a little trigger of a reason to love. So, I only love my brother because he gives or does something that makes me love him. And so when it comes to the subject of love, people are predisposed to loving those they like. It's easier. And maybe even easier to forgive those they like.</p>
        
        <p>But that's not the blueprint, is it? In fact, God's love doesn't just forgive; it forgets (Isaiah 43:25). Your standard for how you dress on how to love and forgive must come from Christ.</p>
        
        <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>Is the love I express only a response to the love I receive from others, or do I love like Christ?</p>
        
        <h3>CONFESSION</h3>
        <p>The Holy Spirit lives inside of me, therefore, I am empowered to love beyond reservations or inclinations.</p>
