        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Ephesians 3:16-17 (NIV)</h2>

            In Ephesians 3:16-17, Paul's prayer for believers is centered on receiving divine strength through the Spirit. The prayer begins by acknowledging that our strength comes from God's glorious riches. In prayer, we recognize that God's resources are inexhaustible, and we have the privilege of drawing strength from His abundance. Philippians 4:19 (NIV) affirms, “And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.”

            The focus of this prayer is not merely physical or external strength but the strengthening of our inner being through the Holy Spirit. In prayer, we invite the Spirit to work within us, fortifying our hearts, minds, and spirits. Romans 8:26 (NIV) assures us, “In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.”

            Divine strength is not just for momentary challenges but for enduring faith and perseverance. In prayer, we seek the fortitude to navigate life's complexities with resilience and faith. Isaiah 40:31 (NIV) encourages us, “But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.”

            The challenges of daily life can be demanding, but prayer provides a way to tap into God's strength continually. Divine strength is needed for all God has placed in your heart to do. Even Jesus needed divine strength to fulfill the Father's will on the cross. There are many things in our lives where willpower alone won't suffice. Psalm 73:26 (NIV) declares, “My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.”
