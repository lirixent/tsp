        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: 2 Corinthians 3:18</h2>
        <p class="verse">“And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            2 Corinthians 3:18 begins with an invitation to contemplate the Lord's glory with unveiled faces. This act of beholding goes beyond casual observation; it is an intentional and focused gaze into the splendor of God. As we fix our eyes on Him, we initiate a process of transformation that begins from the inside out.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The transformative power lies in the act of beholding. As we contemplate the Lord's glory, a metamorphosis occurs. We are gradually and continuously being transformed into His image. This transformation is not a one-time event but an ongoing process, reflecting the image of Christ in our character, attitudes, and actions.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The beauty of this transformation is that it is not stagnant. It is described as "ever-increasing glory," and the source of this transformation is the Lord, who is the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the agent of change, working within us as we fix our gaze on the glory of God. It is through the Spirit's guidance and empowerment that we experience the ever-increasing glory and become more like Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The journey from beholding to becoming is an intentional and ongoing process. It requires a deliberate focus on the Lord's glory, an unveiling of our hearts, and a receptivity to the transformative work of the Holy Spirit. As we behold Him, we are gradually and continually transformed into His image.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Make it a practice to behold the Lord's glory daily, contemplating His splendor with an unveiled heart, allowing the Holy Spirit to work within you. Embrace the journey of transformation, knowing that as you behold Him, you are continually becoming more like Christ. The process of beholding to become is ongoing, and each moment spent in His presence adds a layer of ever-increasing glory to your life.
