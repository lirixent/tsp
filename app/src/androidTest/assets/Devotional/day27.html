        <h1>DAY 27</h1>
        <h2>LAND OF THE FREE!</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: 1 Corinthians 2:12</h3>
        <p>"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Our text teaches that it is through the giving of the Spirit of Christ, whom we have received, that we can come to know the things that have been freely given to us. Because we live in a world where nothing is free, it can be difficult at times to believe that everything can truly be free.</p>

            <p>For the believer, our freedom is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We received our righteousness freely (Romans 3:24 TPT).</li>
                <li>We received the love and grace of God that saved us freely (Titus 3:4).</li>
                <li>Even the faith with which we believed was freely given (Galatians 2:20).</li>
                <li>We have been set free from the bondage of sin and death (Romans 8:2).</li>
                <li>We have been set free from guilt, shame, poverty, and condemnation (Romans 8:1).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are so free, we are the freest people in the world!</p>

            <p>1 Timothy 6:17 and Romans 8:32 emphasize that He not only makes us free, but He also gives us things and experiences freely.</p>

            <p>And so, with all this freedom all around us and within us, we must boldly walk in freedom, as the songwriter says.</p>

            <p>And just as you have freely received, you should also freely give in the same vein (Matthew 10:8):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Freely received salvation? Freely preach salvation.</li>
                <li>Freely received forgiveness? Freely forgive others.</li>
                <li>Freely received power (Acts 1:8)? Freely heal and deliver.</li>
                <li>Freely loved? Freely love others.</li>
                <li>Freely received provision? Freely provide.</li>
                <li>Freely received righteousness? Freely treat others as righteous.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Am I living like one who is truly free?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>I walk in complete freedom.</p>
