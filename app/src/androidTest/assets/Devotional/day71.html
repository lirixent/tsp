    <h1>DAY 71</h1>
    <h2>LOVE CODE: REJOICE IN THE TRUTH</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 3 John 1:4 (NKJV)</p>
    <p>"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth."</p>

    <p>John, the beloved, in verse 3 of today's scripture, said he rejoiced greatly when the report came that Gaius was walking in the truth. Next, he says that his greatest joy is to see his brethren walk in the truth of the Gospel. What truth is John rejoicing about?</p>

    <p>In verse 6, he tells us of the love Gaius had for the church, with even strangers testifying of his love. What amazing selflessness and heart for the gospel!</p>

    <p>In Colossians 1:3-4, we see Paul give thanks and rejoice because the news reaching him concerning the brethren at Colosse was that they had love for all the saints. Think about it: for these two different writers to rejoice about it, then it's worthy of note.</p>

    <p>As believers, we must understand that an evident fruit of being rooted in the gospel is genuine love for all the saints. And from our text, we see that this is an all-encompassing love that caters to the physical well-being and even more importantly, the spiritual health of the saints. This comes with an earnest desire to see your brothers "prosper and walk in health even as their soul prospers," as John puts it in verse 2 of our text.</p>

    <p>Our first and most important expression of love to one another is to minister Christ so as to help our brothers and sisters "walk in the truth" and cater to their needs as often as the opportunity avails itself. This is where we derive the most joy and satisfaction.</p>

        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>When was the last time I prayed for the body of Christ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>Because I have received His love, I have been equipped to have love for all the saints.</p>
