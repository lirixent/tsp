        <h1 class="title">DAY 17: WIN BY YOUR IDENTITY</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Philippians 2:5</h2>
        <p class="verse">“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            When we became believers, we put on Christ (Galatians 3:27). This is why when the word says you have the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16), it means that in every reality that the mind of Christ has, you do too. One translation puts it this way: "You now have Christ's perceptions." So you perceive life and every question or challenge the way Christ would.

            Beloved, your identity is determined in Christ, not anywhere else. Your origin has changed. In Christ, your identity is new and different. See some of the realities that your identity in Christ has brought you into below:
        </p>
        <ol class="content">
            <li>In Him, you are holy and without blemish: Ephesians 1:4: "Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love."</li>
            <li>In Him, you are a son of God!: Galatians 3:26 - "For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith."</li>
            <li>In Christ, we are ALWAYS victorious: 2 Corinthians 2:14 - "Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place."</li>
            <li>You are God's workmanship in Christ, created for good works: Ephesians 2:10 - "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="content">
            Ponder on the realities of your identity in Christ—that you are righteous, that you are blessed, that you are more than conquerors, and that your victory is louder than every circumstance. Ponder on the fact that you are complete in Christ, and His experience is your experience.
