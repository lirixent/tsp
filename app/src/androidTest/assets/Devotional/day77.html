    <h2>THE PRICELESS GIFT</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Peter 1:19 (KJV)</p>
    <p>"but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."</p>

    <p>In a world where value is often tied to the price paid, it's essential to understand the depth of the love God has for us. The global economy operates on the principle that the worth of an item is determined by the price someone is willing to pay for it. However, God's economy operates on a different level altogether.</p>
    
    <p>God confers value on something worthless by purchasing it with something of great value. We were all in total depravity, but God, in His infinite love, redeems us by His most precious sacrifice, which is Jesus. From the human perspective, something worthwhile has to be exchanged in order to access anything of value, so judging by this, it wasn't a worthwhile transaction, but He did it nonetheless. Why? Because we are valuable to Him. In His eyes, we are treasures!</p>
    
    <p>The blood of Jesus is God's purchasing power for the redemption of mankind. Christ was spent on the cross of Calvary to redeem us. In John 3:16, we see the infinite degree of emotion and gift that God's love was expressed in. Scripture says, "God SO loved the world that He gave."</p>
    
    <p>Reflecting on the sacrificial act of God giving His Son, we begin to fathom the profound love He has for each one of us. God didn't spare His most precious possession but freely gave Him for our redemption.</p>
    
    <p>This is where our value comes from, and you will perceive yourself appropriately when you understand who was spent for you. Beloved, move around with confidence because Christ, God's beloved Son, was spent for you!</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>How does knowing that Christ was spent for me influence my self-worth?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I am worth the blood of Jesus, which is my purchasing power. Great value has been conferred on me by the degree of love God has loved me with.</p>
