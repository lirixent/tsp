        <h1>DAY 54 - THE LOVE TEMPLATE</h1>
        <h2>Key Scripture/Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>Romans 5:8 (MSG)<br>
        "But God put his love on the line for us by offering his Son in sacrificial death while we were of no use whatever to him."</p>

        <p>A man falls in love and goes to his father to tell him about her and get his blessing to pursue a relationship with her. His father asks him a question: "If you were told that this lady you love would never love you back, would never be kind to you regardless of what you do, would you still love her or be willing to invest all your resources in this relationship?"</p>

        <p>God must have thought about this question before He gave us Jesus, and He had to have been able to answer the question. Zephaniah 3:17 shows us that He was confident in the ability of His love to win us over, and so He rested in His love.</p>

        <p>And Jesus didn't just say yes; He came and died without any assurance of our loving Him back. What an investment. This is the God kind of love. It didn't begin when we decided to receive Christ, but this love was established long before we chose to receive Him.</p>

        <p>And this kind of love is the template for all who have received Christ to express in return. Someone may ask, "Is this possible? How can I operate from this template?" The advantage of being a believer is that we are empowered not only to know what love demands from us, but also to do it.</p>

        <p>In 2 Corinthians 13:14, we see that it is the Holy Spirit's role to continually remind us of the love and grace of God. He doesn't just tell us, but He empowers us to fulfill love's requirements.</p>

        <p>Love has already been poured lavishly into our hearts through the giving of the Holy Spirit to us (Romans 5:5). We only need to yield to the Spirit, irrespective of how uncomfortable His leading may be or whether it goes against popular opinion or our ego. Christ has given us the template for love. Let's follow it.</p>

            <p>Where do I need to apply Love's template today?</p>

            <p>I live out the love I have received by the Holy Spirit. Today, I dispense the love of God in line with His template.</p>
