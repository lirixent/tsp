        <h1>DAY 48 - THE LONE BLOCK</h1>
        <h2>Key Scripture/Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>1 Peter 5:8-9<br>
        "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world."</p>

        <p>Watching the National Geographic channel (NatGeoWild) on TV can be both a fascinating and eye-opening experience. It gives you an understanding of the behavioral patterns of wild animals, such as how they hunt, and so on. In the wild, the lion roars to instill fear in the hearts of its prey in order to first isolate it from the herd or pack before devouring it.</p>

        <p>In our text today, Peter uses a roaring lion to describe the devil. He roars to instill fear and then "seeks whom he may devour." His roar takes the form of circumstances, challenges, lies, and temptations, all with the sole aim of making us lose our faith in Christ and walk in fear and isolation.</p>

        <p>But we already have victory in Christ! The devil has no power. He has been shamelessly disarmed and disgraced. He can only roar. Verse 9 says to resist him by being steadfast in the faith. The battle for the believer is to keep the faith regardless of the situation that confronts us.</p>

        <p>Another key thing is for us to stay in the company of brethren. As believers, we now form an integral part of the household of God, with each of us like a block in the building of God's house, being fitted together to make a formidable building (Ephesians 2:20-21). According to God's design, bearing each other's burdens helps in the establishment of our faith.</p>

        <p>When facing challenges, remember you are part of God's body. Don't be a lone block.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Do I isolate myself when faced with challenges, or do I rely on God's people?</p>
