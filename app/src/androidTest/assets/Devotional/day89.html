    <h1 style="text-align: center;">DAY 89<br>UNWAVERING PROMISES</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Corinthians 1:20 (NIV)</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"For no matter how many promises God has made, they are 'Yes' in Christ. And so through him, the 'Amen' is spoken by us to the glory of God."</p>
    
    <p>God's promises are not subject to the unpredictability of human endeavors or the fluctuating nature of the world. They are rooted in the unchanging character of God Himself. Hebrews 6:18 (NIV) affirms that "it is impossible for God to lie." Every promise spoken by God is infused with His faithfulness, making them unwavering and trustworthy.</p>
    
    <p>1 Corinthians 1:20 declares that all of God's promises find their "Yes" in Christ. Through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, God's promises are not only ratified but also fulfilled. In Christ, we witness the embodiment of God's unwavering commitment to His people. As believers, we stand on the foundation of this "Yes," confident that God's promises are secure and certain.</p>
    
    <p>While God's promises are unfailing, our response is crucial. The verse continues by stating that "the 'Amen' is spoken by us to the glory of God." Our "Amen" is not merely an affirmation; it is a declaration of agreement and acceptance. When we align our hearts with God's promises and declare our "Amen," we participate in the manifestation of His glory.</p>
    
    <p>Living in the assurance of unwavering promises transforms our perspective on challenges and uncertainties. Romans 8:31 (NIV) reinforces this confidence: "If God is for us, who can be against us?" In the face of adversity, we draw strength from the unshakable promises of a faithful God, knowing that His purposes will prevail.</p>
    
    <p>Ultimately, the unwavering promises of God are a testament to His glory. As we stand on the promises of God, declaring our "Amen" in faith, His glory is revealed in and through our lives. We become vessels through which the faithfulness of God shines forth, drawing others to the unchanging and reliable nature of our Creator.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>Do I still harbor doubts about certain areas of my life?</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">CONFESSION</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">I say "Yes" to all God's promises for me in Christ.</p>
