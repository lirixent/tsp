    <h1 style="text-align: center;">DAY 90<br>SOURCE OF STRENGTH</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: I Thessalonians 5:11 (NIV)</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact, you are doing."</p>
    
    <p>The New Testament is replete with exhortations to encourage one another. Whether facing trials, challenges, or celebrating victories, believers are called to be a source of strength to those around them. Hebrews 10:24-25 (NIV) emphasizes the importance of considering how to spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not neglecting to meet together for mutual encouragement.</p>
    
    <p>Our words hold the power to uplift, inspire, and provide strength to those who may be going through difficult seasons. Proverbs 16:24 (NIV) beautifully expresses this truth: "Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones." Being intentional about speaking words of encouragement can have a profound impact on the emotional and spiritual well-being of fellow believers.</p>
    
    <p>Being a source of strength extends beyond words to actions. Modeling a life of faith, resilience, and compassion serves as a powerful form of encouragement. Philippians 2:3-4 (NIV) encourages believers to consider others above themselves, looking not only to their interests but also to the interests of others. By living out a Christlike example, we become a source of strength through our deeds.</p>
    
    <p>Interceding for fellow believers is another essential way to be a source of strength. James 5:16 (NIV) underscores the significance of prayer within the community of faith: "Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." Prayer binds believers together, providing strength in times of need.</p>
    
    <p>When thoughts of your brother or sister come to your mind, say a prayer for them, reach out to them. In this way, you would be a source of strength to them and edify Christ's body.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>What are some other ways I can serve as a source of strength to other believers?</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">CONFESSION</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">My eyes are open to fellow believers and I serve as a source of strength.</p>
