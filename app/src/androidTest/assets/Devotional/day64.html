    <h1>DAY 64</h1>
    <h2>PROFIT OR LOSS?</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: 1 Corinthians 13:3</p>
    <p>"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing."</p>

    <p>As a believer, the first thing that characterizes or identifies you is love (1 John 4:7,8). Your love is a pointer to who you are born of. Looking at our text today, can I ask you a question: Who does love benefit? The giver or the recipient? It's the giver.</p>

    <p>Think about this, naturally, children almost don't know the difference between people's personalities, but they can be very perceptive. If you are a loving person, a child will naturally be drawn to you because the child can perceive it.</p>

    <p>I hope you know it was love that drove Jesus to the cross. He humbled Himself and made Himself of no reputation (Philippians 2:7). This is God. How much more us?</p>

    <p>Everything you think you ought to be proud of is incomparable to Christ. Philippians 3:7,8 says we count it as dung, as waste matter.</p>

    <p>Have you come across believers who are highly placed in society/governance serving in church? That ought to be our posture: love and service in humility.</p>

    <p>Beloved, don't take pride in being unapproachable. Instead, yield yourself to the spirit of love, and it will be credited to your account. Simply put, we are beneficiaries in the act of love.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>What does my account statement show? Profit or Loss?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>I am yielded to the spirit of love and submitted to its teachings. In the business of love, I am not losing. I make profit only.</p>
