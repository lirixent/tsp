        <h1 class="title">DAY 11: PRAYER - TO KNOW THE RICHES WE HAVE IN CHRIST</h1>
        <h2 class="key-scripture">Key Scripture/Memory Verse: Philemon 1:6 (NIV)</h2>
        <p class="verse">“I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ.”</p>
        <p class="content">
            In Ephesians 1:18, Paul's prayer is not only for the enlightenment of the eyes of believers' hearts to know the hope of God's calling but also to comprehend the vast riches found in Christ. Through prayer, we invite the Holy Spirit to enlighten our hearts, allowing us to see beyond the surface and perceive the spiritual truths that accompany our identity in Christ.

        <p class="content">
            The riches we have in Christ are not merely material wealth, though they can manifest materially; however, they encompass spiritual blessings, redemption, and grace lavished upon believers. In prayer, we seek to know and fully comprehend the immeasurable worth of our inheritance in Christ. Philippians 4:19 (NIV) reassures us, “And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The prayer extends to the concept of a "glorious inheritance." Our inheritance is not only rich but also glorious—a reflection of the splendor and majesty of God's grace. As we pray, we become aware of the spiritual treasures that await us as heirs of God. Romans 8:17 (NIV) reinforces this truth: “Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            The riches in Christ far surpass any earthly wealth. We delve into the depths of spiritual abundance—forgiveness, redemption, eternal life, and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. Colossians 2:2-3 (NIV) emphasizes the importance of knowing Christ, “in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Knowing the riches in Christ through prayer is not merely an intellectual understanding but an invitation to live in the fullness of Christ. Colossians 2:9-10 (NIV) declares, “For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and in Christ you have been brought to fullness.” Prayer guides us into a life that reflects the completeness found in our relationship with Christ.
