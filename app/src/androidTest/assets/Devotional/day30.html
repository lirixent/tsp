        <h1>DAY 30</h1>
        <h2>FOCUS BLINDS</h2>
        <h3>Key Scripture/Memory Verse: 1 Corinthians 2:5 (NKJV)</h3>
        <p>"..that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God."</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>In today's text, Paul is urging the Corinthian church to shift their focus from the wisdom of men to the power of God. The term "power" used here is the same Greek word <em>dynamis</em> found in Romans 1:16, where Paul declares that the gospel is the power of God for the salvation of men.</p>

            <p>By implication, Paul is encouraging them to center their faith on the gospel, to place their trust in the gospel rather than the prevailing wisdom of the time. Paul possessed a mindset regarding the gospel that was firmly opposed to other mindsets. And as believers, this should be our mindset as well. He was so protective of the gospel's truth that he even challenged those who opposed it (Galatians 1:8,9).</p>

            <p>Paul understood that the only way to counter the wisdom of men was to magnify Christ, who embodies both the wisdom and power of God (1 Corinthians 1:24).</p>

            <p>The gospel is not merely the Good News about Christ—His sacrificial death for our sins, His payment for our forgiveness, and our eternal union with God—but it is also the answer to every question humanity faces!</p>

            <p>As a believer, your mindset should reflect this truth—that the gospel of Christ has radically transformed your life! Your faith should be indifferent to the wisdom of men and firmly grounded in the wisdom and power of God, which is encapsulated in the Gospel of Christ. Stand firm against the lies and deceit of the devil, who seeks to divert your attention.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Do I respond to situations from man's wisdom or the wisdom of the gospel?</p>

        <h3>Confession</h3>
        <p>- My faith is in the Gospel.<br>- I'm saved by Grace, not by anything I did or will do.</p>
