    <h1>DAY 74</h1>
    <h2>LOVE CODE: MEEKNESS</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: James 3:13</p>
    <p>"Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom."</p>

    <p>Do you know that as a believer, the reality that you are a loving being is not make-believe? It's your position.</p>
    
    <p>Our text today is instructional for how we ought to work or conduct ourselves. It speaks of meekness as what should drive our actions. If we circle back to the fruit of the Spirit, which is love, in Galatians 5:22, you'll find that one of the ways this fruit of love is expressed is in meekness.</p>
    
    <p>The character of meekness is the character of being even-tempered, irrespective of what comes at you. That is, your loving response is not reactionary or easily provoked (1 Corinthians 13:5).</p>
    
    <p>In Ephesians 4:2 Paul said, "Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your love." When you have conversations with people, let your conversation be endearing; be so amicable that there is grace in your speech (Ephesians 4:29).</p>
    
    <p>Scripture says let your words be seasoned with salt. That is, your words are preservative, and you are aware of how your words affect people.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>Does my conduct and speech reflect meekness? Are there areas of my life I need to conform to the truth?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>Meekness is worked out in me. The words of my mouth are preservative and amicable. I have the nature of Christ and so I follow His pattern of service in meekness and humility.</p>
    </div>
