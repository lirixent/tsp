    <h1>DAY 67</h1>
    <h2>PERFECT LOVE</h2>

    <p class="memory-verse">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: I John 4:12</p>
    <p>"No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us."</p>

    <p>The primary way we can represent God to our world is by loving our neighbour. Not loving them in our own way, but loving them with the love of God in Christ. Christ didn't just do things for us; He gave Himself to us. The act of giving Himself represents love because He is the personification of God's love.</p>

    <p>The word perfect in Greek means "to complete.‚Äù So perfect love is God's love completed. So when we say love has been perfected, it means love received has become love expressed.</p>

    <p>In our text, John says that no one has seen God at any time. This means that the only way people are going to see God is by experiencing the love of God in Christ which we have received.</p>

    <p>Therefore, if I'm going to truly love my neighbour, it has to be through the love of Christ. It has to be by dying to self and allowing Christ to live through me. In that way, as John puts it, "Love has been perfected in us."</p>

    <p>There would always be an opportunity to express this love.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>What areas of my life do I need to express the love of Christ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession">
        <h2>CONFESSION</h2>
        <p>By loving, I carry proof of the presence of God. Daily, I die to self and I express Christ.</p>
    </div>
