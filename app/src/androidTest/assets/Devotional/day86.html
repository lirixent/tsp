    <h1 style="text-align: center;">DAY 86<br>POWER OF THE TONGUE</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">KEY SCRIPTURE/MEMORY VERSE: Proverbs 18:21 (NIV)</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits."</p>
    
    <p>Our words are not mere sounds; they are vessels of power. Proverbs 18:21 paints a vivid picture of the impact our tongue can have—either bringing life or casting a shadow of death. Our words shape the atmosphere around us, influencing the dynamics of our relationships, and contributing to the overall tone of our lives.</p>
    
    <p>Consider the relationships in your life—family, friends, colleagues. Our words can either build or break these connections. Ephesians 4:29 (NIV) encourages us to speak only what is helpful for building others up, imparting grace to those who hear. Speaking life involves choosing words that encourage, affirm, and uplift, fostering an environment of love and mutual support.</p>
    
    <p>The impact of spoken words extends beyond immediate interactions. Just as a stone creates ripples when tossed into a pond, our words create a ripple effect in the lives of others. Positive and life-giving words have the potential to inspire, motivate, and bring hope, creating a ripple effect that reaches far beyond our initial expression.</p>
    
    <p>Speaking life is not only about impacting others; it is also a catalyst for personal transformation. Our self-talk—the dialogue we have with ourselves—shapes our mindset, influences our emotions, and directs our actions.</p>
    
    <p>As we intentionally choose words of life, we cultivate a positive and empowering internal dialogue that aligns with God's truth.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>Has my words brought life and encouragement, or have they contributed to negativity and discouragement?</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">CONFESSION</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">I am committed to speaking encouragement to myself and everyone around me.</p>
